# MiscDemos
Old VB6 demos of mine converted to tB with no additional features/notes

**IFileDialog64** = This shows conversion of my VB6 project [[VB6] Using the new IFileDialog interface for customizable Open/Save](https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?786031-VB6-Using-the-new-IFileDialog-interface-for-customizable-Open-Save-(TLB-Vista-)) at each stage in converting to x64: The original VB6 import that works as-is with no modification, switching definitions to WinDevLib, updating for x64 support, and finally eliminating unncessary v-table swapping by using new tB features.
